    <a class="first">Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.</a>
    <a class="second">Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.</a>
    <a class="third">Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.</a>
    <a class="fourth">Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.</a>
