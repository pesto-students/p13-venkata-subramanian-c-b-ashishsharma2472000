    <p>
        I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
        
        Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
        
        Then there's a pair of us! <br>
       
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know! <br>
        
    </p>



    <p>
        How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br>

        How public - like a Frog - <br>

        To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog! <br>
